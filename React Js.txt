What is state?
1) State is a built in object of the React Components.
2) The State object is used to store all the data that belongs to that particular 
component only.
3) The state is only accessible inside the component it belongs to.
4) State is mutable, it can be changed as per the need
5) Whenever the state object changes the component is re-rendered 
6) To use state inside a class component "this.state" is used.

What is "Props"?
1) React is a component based library which divides the UI into little
resusable pieces.

2) In some cases, those components need to communicate (send data to each other)
and the way to pass data between components is by using props.

3) "Props" is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is 
being used for passing data from one component to another. 

4) But the important part here is that data with props are being passed in 
a uni-directional flow. (one way from parent to child).
