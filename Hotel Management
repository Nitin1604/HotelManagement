Hotel Management Project using React JS

In this project i have using react js to make this project. This project has four web pages these are as follows:-

1) login.js when clicking on Hotel Managemenet
2) Home.js
3) About.js
4) Contact.js

These all pages happened with the help of the Router. The functionalities of Router is whenever user clicks on link it will go to another web page for example When clciking on the Contact.js it will redirect to Contact web page as so on.
